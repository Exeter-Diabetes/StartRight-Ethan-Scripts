# StartRight-Ethan-Scripts
This repo hosts all of Ethan de Villiers' scripts for working with the StartRight Dataset

Introduction
- StartRight dataset (n ~= 1800)
- Using Dr. Beverley Shields', Dr. Angus Jones' and Anita Hill's type-1 diabetes models
- Are these models able to identify patients who have been "misdiagnosed" as Type-2 Diabetes?
- Cohort = initially diagnosed as "type 2" patients who go onto insulin ("type 1 progression") within 3 years
- Do the models identify these individuals compared to "type 2" patients who do not progress to insulin?
- Do the models discriminate better than the current standard test: antibodies? (GAD in particular)
- Can the models identify patients who are at high risk, and who would benefit from Antibody testing (acting as a screening tool)?
